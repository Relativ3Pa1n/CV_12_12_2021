I don’t have a traditional background in tech but I have always been ahead of the curve when it came to dealing with computers and networks. Most of that comes from wanting to play computer games and having to build a computer peice by peice in order to afford a rig that would play World of Warcraft when it came out in 2004. At the time I had to chose between a graphics card and a full version of an operating system. I chose the graphics card and in the process learned my first kiosk break-out so I could continue to use the computer after the trial had ended. 

I started college in 2007 to record and produce music. It became apperant pretty quickly that the most expensive software required alot of money and hardware in order to run it. Once again I was in a position where I couldn't afford the tools that I wanted in order to create and produce music. This once again led to understanding how the software was checking for these things and what I could do to convince it to be available to me, for educational purposes. This taught me to be tenacious and that almost anything can be learned on the internet. These lessons I take with me even today as I continue to convince technology to work for me.
